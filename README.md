==== GETTING STARTED ====

Each component must be configured separately, but you can download them all with one command.

> git submodule update --init --recursive

The /Analyzer /Dashboard and /Repository directories should now contain the necessary files to configure and deploy these components. Each project has its own README documentation that must be followed to enable the component.
