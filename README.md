- Debian/Ubuntu Linux-based laptop, server or virtual server
- 1GB Memory
- At least 24GB Storage
- "git" software installed (sudo apt-get install git-core)

==== GETTING STARTED ====

Each component must be configured separately, but you can download them all with one command.

1) Clone this repo: https://github.com/guardianproject/InformaRepo.git

2) Initialize this repo's submodules: git submodule update --init --recursive

The /Analyzer /Dashboard and /Repository directories should now contain the necessary files to configure and deploy these components. Each project has its own README documentation that must be followed to enable the component.
